# Oceano Cashback Service API

This documentation is for the Oceano Cashback Backend Service API. The Oceano Cashback Backend Service API is a RESTful API that allows you to manage users, products, and orders in the Deep Dive Platform. The API is both connected to a PostgreSQL database and a blockchain network (POLYGON, MUMBAI) and user balances are reflected as ERC20-compliant SAL tokens on the blockchain.
